# Book Search Engine 

## Description 
This is a refactor of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. It now uses a  GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

## Installation 
- `git clone` this repository 
- run `npm install` for all dependencies 
- `npm run develop` to run a development version of the application on your local server

## Usage 
Users can sign-up, login, and search few new books to read on any topic they can imagine! Use the deployed application to search for and save books to go back and check out later when you have more time. Delete books from your saved list once you've had a chance to read them or simply change your mind. Happy searching!
